Modern English has spread around the world since the 17th century as a consequence of 
the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States of America. 
Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries, English has become 
the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and 
professional contexts such as science, navigation and law. English is the most spoken language 
in the world and the third-most spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese 
and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language 
or one of the official languages in 59 sovereign states. There are more people who have 
learned English as a second language than there are native speakers. As of 2005, it was 
estimated that there were over 2 billion speakers of English. English is the majority 
native language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and 
the Republic of Ireland, and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, 
South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. It is a co-official language of the United Nations, 
the European Union and many other world and regional international organisations. It is 
the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this 
Indo-European branch.
